# Volunteer-Sign-up-for-NGOs-
In this Project we designed and developed a website Volunteer4us.org which is a web platform to connect NGOs and Volunteers. The website facilitates a user to signup, view the events conducted by various NGOs, filter them based on category, search based on type, place or description and register for those events in the future. 
Also, a user wonâ€™t be able to sign up for a past event or an event where maximum volunteers have already signed up.
The website also allows the NGO to send email to administrator to register an event in the website.
It should display details about the event, date, venue, maximum number of volunteers required etc.
The administrator should be able to add and delete events and NGOs. Also, administrator should
be able to cancel the registration of a user for a particular event.
This project, hence is the development of such an application with a professional outlook.
